# Wikipelago

Wikipelago is a custom [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) world inspired by wiki racing.

Each round gives you a **Start article** and a **Target article**. You navigate Wikipedia links to reach the target, send checks to Archipelago, collect progression, and eventually clear the goal.

##  How Wikipelago Works:
Wikipelago is an Archipelago custom world based on Wikipedia racing.

Each round gives you a Start article and a Target article.
You navigate by clicking Wikipedia links to reach the Target.
When you reach the Target, that check is sent to Archipelago.

As you progress, you collect Knowledge Fragments and other progression items.
Those unlock more rounds and eventually let you clear the Grand Goal.
